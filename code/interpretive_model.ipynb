    "\n",
    "Our goals for this notebook:\n",
    "1. Build a logistic regression model.\n",
    "    * In order to have interpretability for the symptoms, we'll build a logistic regression model that will provide log-odds betas for each feature allowing us to analyze each feature's individual influence on the odds of a COVID-19 test being positive.\n",
    "2. Attempt to improve our model through oversampling and undersampling strategies to correct for the imbalance in our target variable.\n",
    "    * Special thanks to Jason Brownlee and his posts ['Cost-Sensitive Logistic Regression for Imbalanced Classification'](https://machinelearningmastery.com/cost-sensitive-logistic-regression/) and ['Random Oversampling and Undersampling for Imbalanced Classification'](https://machinelearningmastery.com/random-oversampling-and-undersampling-for-imbalanced-classification/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note:** We will evaluate the fit of our model based on the true positive rate (also called recall or sensitivity). This metric measures our ability to maximize classifying actual positive tests correctly as we seek to minimize the number of actual positive tests that our model incorrectly classifies as negative tests."

    "The above dataframe shows all features with a p-value < 0.01 along with their betas (as log-odds) and their exponentiated values. The two features from our previous dataset, `onset` and `cough_comb` now are at the top of our list with the remaining four feature being clinical vital measurements. We didn't regularize or standardize our data, and the some of the scales (particularly with the large number of outliers for vital signs) may not give us the best results. We will need to examine that further.\n",

    "* For every 1-unit increase in the onset measurement, the patient is 1.383 times as likely to test positive for COVID-19, all else being held constant. \n",
    "* For every 1-unit increase in cough rating, the patient is 1.313 times as likely to test positive for COVID-19, all else being held constant. \n",

    "Please note that the interpretations are based on a 1 unit increase in the feature. When the cases are binary, the change simply reflects a patient reporting whether or not they have the symptom. Other features are continuous or ordinal values (`cough_comb`, `onset`, and `sob_comb`), so please reference the data dictionary and cleaning notebook to accurately apply the 1 unit increase for these features."
